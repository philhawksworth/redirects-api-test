    <h1>Testing redirects: Dev vs Deployed</h1>
    <p>
      It appears thay the redirects API is honoured differently locally while using Netlify Dev, to globally once deployed ot our ADN. Specifically with regards to resolving to assets served by Netlify Large Media.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following links and their described expecred behaviour exist for the purposed of testing this assertion, and all point to assets managed under Netlify Large Media on a seperate project.
    </p>


    <h2>Test links</h2>
    <p>
      All the links below are some sort of redirect or proxy to an existing image asset served by Netlify using NLM.<br />
      (<a href="https://lazy-load-nlm.netlify.com/images/lighthouse-5.jpg">https://lazy-load-nlm.netlify.com/images/lighthouse-5.jpg</a>), with the redirects configure in a netlify.toml file.

        <p class="note">
          Image transform via querystring paramaters. No redirects in effect.
